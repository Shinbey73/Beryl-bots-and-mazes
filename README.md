Originally developed as a staged coursework project; refactored and consolidated for public release.
# Beryl-bots-and-mazes
A Python mini-game set on planet BERYL, where players traverse mazes, manage in-game currency, and outsmart sentient AI bots. Built as a staged assignment with weekly checkpoints, then consolidated into a single runnable module.

## Features
- Character setup with unique naming and dynamic welcome messages
- BERYL currency utilities (convert, collect/deplete with indicators)
- Maze helpers to validate coordinates and render positions
- Drone scanning logic with early target detection
- Traversal that updates resources along the path
